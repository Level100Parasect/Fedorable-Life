Fedorable Life - the world's first and only text-based neckbeard life simulation game
=====

##What is Fedorable Life?
Fedorable Life is a text-based life simulation game where players get to live the life of a 20-something fedora wielding neckbeard.

Players need to make sure they keep their neckbeard happy by playing enough video games and getting into enough internet arguments all while trying to make enough money and improving your life.

##Where can I play Fedorable Life?
Fedorable Life is a web browser game made in HTML5. Currently it uses local storage for save data and as a result is currently only playable in Google Chrome and FireFox. Multibrowser compatibility will be added in a future update.

Play the official game here:

##Goals
* Create a simple text-based game that focuses on the hoarding aspect of a stereotypical neckbeard's life.
* Write enough randomized events so that players rarely ever run into duplicate events.
* Reward the player with multiple endings and unlockable perks.
* Playable on all major web browsers.
* Invoke a few laughs from the players (Aiming for at least 2).
