			<text>While on the pick up artist subreddit, you gave some random AFC advice on how to pick up women: if you want to attract a girl at a bar, you need to dress like a true gentlesir and stay in the corner ignoring everybody while trying to look mysterious. Your advice was so euphoric, that the other pick up artists started to call you out! They said that method of pick up is outdated; "Nobody would approach you if you did that". In order to regain your PUA cred, you can either:</text>
			<choiceA>Post a fabricated story where you game on 2 Asian women and took both of them home in one night</choiceA>
			<choiceB>Call everyone unintelligent beta males and say that they will never understand how alpha you are</choiceB>

			<text>Obsessively partaking in the social networking website creddit, you were searching  for the answers to one of life's biggest questions: why do nice guys finish last? And by search I mean you wrote a whiny essay where you complain about how nice guys finish last, douchebags always win, and how the women are missing out for not choosing to date you. After submitting your soliloquy, you read the replies and they disagree with you! The common response was "Nice guys don't finish last, boring guys do". Wiping away your nice guy tears, you type your response:</text>

			<text>Browsing through the social networking site creddit, you stumbled upon the thread "European vs. Japanese Swords". You scoff at the morons who believe European swords stand a chance against the glorious Nippon blade, however it's actually a fairly even argument. One posted a 4 paragraph essay explaining why European swords are stronger; the European design craft a more sturdy blade due to science and physics!

You replied to the mother's comment; "God doesn't exist. She made it because of the skill of the surgeon." Suddenly people started roasting you!

You decide to go for broke; "Assuming you haven't blocked me or deleted your account, I take it that you weren't creeped out by me tracking you down. I think you are beautiful. I understand I'm not much, but I would worship you." After some waiting, she has not replied yet so you decide to give this last message your all:</text>

You read in a PUA book that erotic first messages lead to more sex; so you tried it with this girl: "M'lady, I just thought of your perfect bare body as I caressed myself. I thought I should let you know." After a moment, she replied with "Creepy!" A one word reply!?!? Surely your message should've warranted more than that!

			<text>On the gaming website MGN, you posted a picture of your poorly recolored OC you called "Murdermaster the Porcupine" with the caption of "Pretty neat, huh?" Taking pride in your hard work, you were shocked when people started to make fun of your creation. "Did you just poorly trace over the original character and made it edgier?" No! Murdermaster has a dark and troubled back story and the character design reflects the character's personality. You decide to defend your hard work from these vision-less plebs:</text>

So who knows, maybe your character will be in a future game in spirit! ARGUMENT WON</responseCorrect>

You decide to leave your opinion: "The new game is garbage - nothing can even come close to being better than the classics." Feeling like you covered your bases, a commenter asked you to back up your claims:</text>

Your comment was received in a mostly negative light mentioning that "Celebrities are people too.":</text>
