		<text>While on the pick up artist subreddit, you gave some random AFC advice on how to pick up women: if you want to attract a girl at a bar, you need to dress like a true gentlesir and stay in the corner ignoring everybody while trying to look mysterious. Your advice was so euphoric, that the other pick up artists started to call you out! They said that method of pick up is outdated; "Nobody would approach you if you did that". In order to regain your PUA cred, you can either:</text>
        <choiceA>Post a fabricated story where you game on 2 Asian women and took both of them home in one night</choiceA>
        <choiceB>Call everyone unintelligent beta males and say that they will never understand how alpha you are</choiceB>

You scoff at the morons who believe European swords stand a chance against the glorious Nippon blade, however it's actually a fairly even argument. One post was a 4 paragraph essay explaining why European swords are stronger; the European design craft a more sturdy blade due to science and physics!

		<text>On the gaming website MGN, they posted up a review for the thirteenth instalment of a popular JRPG series. Unfortunately the plebs running MGN gave the game a paltry score of 6/10 stating the sequel fails to capture the fantasy and the adventure of the games before it. They say that the game is too linear, the characters are unlikable, and the gameplay is nonexistant. You haven't played the game yet, but you love the series and it deserves better! You look through the reviewer's past publications and note that he gave low scores to a lot of your cherished games. Now this jerk made it personal! You start to craft your words onto the comments section of the review:</text>

		<text>On the gaming website MGN, you saw a review for a Plebstation 4 exclusive game that got a measly 7/10. Typically you're a PC gamer, but if you had to side with either of the consoles, you would choose the Bonebox. When you saw the review, it felt like your team won and that the console war was over! You rush to the comments section and without a thought wrote "R.I.P Plebstation 4. No match for the mighty Bonebox!" However the Plebstation fanboys won't take this sitting down; they all comment saying that the Plebstation 4 is winning the console war, but you are more educated than these plebs. You decide to educate these fanboys:</text>

		<text>On the gaming website MGN, there was a thread where OP was asking for opinions on which console to buy between the Bonebox and the Plebstation 4. Obviously the better of these two choices is the PC as it has modding support and is not limited by the laws of the universe. You reply to the thread with "PC Master Race; console plebs gonna hate." This however put a target on your back from the other commenters as they all started to flame you saying "PC wasn't even an option." and asking you to learn how to read. You, an avid reader of pony fanfiction do know how to read and think that PC gaming is the best thing since underwear. You have two ways of replying to these console dweebs:</text>

		<text>On the gaming website MGN, there was an article about a robot piloting JRPG game from Japan getting censored upon its localization to North America. Logically this makes sense because the main heroine is under 18 and has multiple risqué costumes that are getting removed. You don't really know why, but this irks you! Probably because these costumes turn you on. One commented that this censorship is a good thing because it's creepy to fantasize about digitally youthful women. How can anybody be against sexy costumes!? Is he even human? You decide to put this pleb in his place by informing him why his beliefs are wrong:</text>

		<text>You were on the video-sharing website LouTube watching a tribute video to a popular celebrity who recently died. You were about to leave your regards to one of your favorite celebrities, but one comment caught your eye: "What kind of cruel God would take him away from us?!" Your atheism got the better of you and you replied to the comment with "A God that doesn't exist" Tipping your fedora, you imagined yourself as a bad-ass for leaving that comment. However people start calling you an insensitive prick for mocking the death of a celebrity:</text>
		<choiceA>Explain that your intentions were misinterpreted; you meant to leave your condolences to the celebrity</choiceA>
        <choiceB>Use science and logical thought to temper your argument that God does not exist</choiceB>
		<answer>ansA</answer>
		<responseCorrect>The commenters mention that it's hard to interpret your comment as anything else, but hey, at least they are not yelling at you! ARGUMENT WIN!</responseCorrect>
		<responseWrong>They continue to call you a prick because they think this video is not a good forum for discussing beliefs. The fools don't know that it's always a good time to discuss atheism! ARGUMENT LOSE</responseWrong>

		<text>You were on the video-sharing website LouTube watching video created by a popular female cosplayer. Reading through the comments, one caught your eye saying "So beautiful!" This comment doesn't really bother you, but you really wanted the attention of m'lady. So you had a plan of defending her honor so she could see it and inevitably fall in love! You replied to the commenter, "Beautiful as in physically attractive? How typical of lesser men such as yourself. When I think of beauty, I think of a women's passion and their dreams." You wait for m'lady to respond, but the only responses were from bullies calling you a try-hard. Defend your honor from these louts:</text>
		<choiceA>"I'm just stating how I feel. I miss the days when beauty was the whole package"</choiceA>
        <choiceB>Make an underscore line and underneath it, type in "Everybody above this line is a loser!"</choiceB>
		<answer>ansA</answer>
		<responseCorrect>While your plan to win over the heart and body of the female cosplayer failed, but your comment has a total of two likes! Overall success! ARGUMENT WIN!</responseCorrect>

		<text>You were on the video-sharing website LouTube watching viral video where people prank gold diggers. Most of the comments were poking fun at the women getting pranked, but something within this video really boiled your brownies! This video solidifies why you're not in the dating scene; money means everything! You left a comment on the video, "This is why 2D girls > 3D girls. 2D girls are loyal and don't care about how much you make!" This raised some questions from some commenters "...so you're admitting to whacking it to pixels then?" Beep yeah you do! Why should you take shame in that fact? You decide to explain to this pleb the infinite pros of pixelated women:</text>
		<choiceA>Mention when one watches "3D" porn, the video is rendered as a 2D image so they enjoy pixels too!</choiceA>
        <choiceB>Mention that it is a fetish. People like feet, other people like getting stepped on. You like pixels</choiceB>
		<answer>ansB</answer>
		<responseCorrect>The commenter replied with a "Yeah, I guess that's correct, but it still weirds me out." The pleb agrees with you! ARGUMENT WIN!</responseCorrect>

Laughing so hard your neighbors probably think you're a lunatic, you scroll through the comments section. One comment caught your eye; "Bronies are freaks!" Whoa whoa whoa... "Ponies in High School" is more than just a show about ponies, it's a way of life. It's smart wit and good characterization often gets misinterpreted due to the colorful exterior. You decide to educate this man about something he probably doesn't care too much about:</text>

		<text>You were on the video-sharing website LouTube watching a top 10 list video for "Anime That Needs to Die". Agreeing with the garbage anime on the list so far, you lost control of your tear glands when you saw your favorite anime at number two. Wiping away the tears, you show the list maker a piece of your mind: "Number 2 shouldn't be on there! It's a bloody classic you Neanderthals!" Your response garnered some disagreeing comments. One stated "It was a great series in the beginning, but it devolved quickly after the lead writer left." What does that even mean? He should be more constructive with his feedback:</text>
		<choiceA>"The anime has evolved as a series. More sub plots, more characterization, and more fan service."</choiceA>
        <choiceB>"Care to elaborate more with your critique of the anime? Nothing worse than a critic who doesn't know anything."</choiceB>
		<answer>ansA</answer>
		<responseCorrect>"Not really... The anime is garbage because of those reasons you listed." Thinking long and hard about how to reply, you come up with a cool "Well that's like, your opinion, man." The commenter never replies back and you take this as an ARGUMENT WIN!</responseCorrect>
		<responseWrong>"Sure thing. After the first arc, the series devolved into a harem anime. All characterization goes out the window, endless filler episodes, bad animation ..." The commenter continues on and on listing off negative traits about the anime. Maybe the anime hasn't aged as well as you thought... ARGUMENT LOSE</responseWrong>

Eventually you stumbled onto a music video of a female rapper who was singing about women with big butts. While the video did arouse you, the music hurt your ears. You left your opinion on the video with a "This sounds like garbage!" A few moments later, somebody with a lower intelligence replied to your comment. "Why are you even here then if you don't even like the music?" This poster is missing the big picture. Ignoring the commenter's question you start typing up a reply with one hand:</text>

As an atheist, if you study any form of science, you would not stand for the logical fallacies of this movie such as I." Some commenter with no taste replied to your comment; "Logical fallacies?

You need not cheapen your beauty." Thinking that maybe m'lady will reply to your comment with desire, you were honestly shocked when people started flaming you! "Do you tell people this in person?
